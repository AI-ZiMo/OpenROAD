# TODO: this file should eventually be empty. Right now it still pulls in a lot
# dependencies via bazel_rules_hdl which are not needed anymore as they are
# handled in MODULE.bazel
# Next step: be specific _which_ rules are imported from bazel_rules_hdl,
# remove the rest. Then the TODO is clear what is next.
